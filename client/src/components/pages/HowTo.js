        <p>Gone are the days of joining a video call with your friends and spending 
          half an hour trying to decide which game to play. There's always some Friend A 
          with a very strong opinion, a Friend B with an even stronger opposing opinion, 
          and the rest of the group, who maybe slightly prefer Codenames but not enough 
          to risk getting caught in the Friend-A-Friend-B crossfire. Someone sends a 
          Messenger poll, which everyone but Friend A and B ignores because they don't 
          even care what game they choose, they just want to do something.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Decision-making dread is the bane of your friend group's virtual hangouts, 
          and you know it. We made <em>pollen</em> to quell those qualms. By turning polling 
          into its own enjoyable mini-activity rather than a necessary evil every time 
          your friends want to watch a movie together, we're intending to make indecision obsolete.</p>
