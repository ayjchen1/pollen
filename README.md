# pollen

Welcome to *pollen*, your new beehive of casual decision-making activity! From picking a movie or restaurant to brainstorming for a project, *pollen* is all about propagating ideas and choices.

## We're all allergic to this scenario...

"What do you want to do?"

"I don't know, what do *you* want to do?"

"I'm fine with anything you want."

Gone are the days of joining a video call with your friends and spending half an hour trying to decide which game to play. There's always some Friend A with a very strong opinion, a Friend B with an even stronger opposing opinion, and the rest of the group, who maybe slightly prefer Codenames but not enough to risk getting caught in the Friend-A-Friend-B crossfire. Someone sends a Messenger poll, which everyone but Friend A and B ignores because they don't even care what game they choose, they just want to do *something*.

Decision-making dread is the bane of your friend group's virtual hangouts, and you know it. We made *pollen* to quell those qualms. By turning polling into its own enjoyable mini-activity rather than a necessary evil every time your friends want to watch a movie together, we're intending to make indecision obsolete.

## Features
- Ability to vote, and unvote, for multiple options
- Ability to add your own option if you're not satisfied with the available choices
- Ability to see everyone's votes, because anonymity and secrecy have no place in casual settings
- At-a-glance grid view of all your polls, with information about their tags and number of votes and options
- Ability to add one or more tags to categorize your poll (e.g. food, travel, games)
- Color-coordination by tag
